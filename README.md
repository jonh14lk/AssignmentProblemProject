# AssignmentProblemProject
Repository with the codes that were used in the project that talk about the idea of max-flow as a solution to the linear assignment problem.

#To run the code 

Just compile and run the code.

```c
g++ main.cpp -o main_executable
```
If you want, you can run a custom file of test case.

```c
./main_executable <test_case.in
```
