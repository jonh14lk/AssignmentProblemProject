# AssignmentProblemProject
Repository with the codes that were used in the project that talk about the idea of max-flow as a solution to the linear assignment problem.

"There are M job applicants and N jobs. Each applicant has a subset of jobs that he/she is interested in. Each job opening can only accept one applicant and a job applicant can be appointed for only one job. Find an assignment of jobs to applicants in such that as many applicants as possible get jobs."

# To run the code 

Just compile and run the code.

```c
g++ main.cpp -o main_executable
```
If you want, you can run a custom file of test case.


you can also create a test case with "test_case_generator.cpp"

```c
./main_executable <test_case.in
```
